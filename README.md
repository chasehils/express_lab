# express_lab

I kept trying to figure out how to go about accomplishing 
this lab and was having problems. I was able to get the server going
but I was having problems with my functions.
I tried to go about changing some things around to see what
would work and ended up referring to the class part for help.
For some reason there are two folders that didnt commit and
seem not to connect. I kept getting an error with the 'views' 
folder.
